## Description

This repository includes a variety of projects that cover the implementation, optimization, and analysis of different sorting algorithms. The projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with algorithms and help develop problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific sorting algorithm or related task. Below is a brief overview of the directories and their contents:

- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
- `1-insertion_sort_list.c`: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm for doubly linked lists.
- `2-selection_sort.c`: Implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
- `3-quick_sort.c`: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
- `100-shell_sort.c`: Implementation of the shell sort algorithm.
- `101-cocktail_sort_list.c`: Implementation of the cocktail shaker sort algorithm for doubly linked lists.
- `102-counting_sort.c`: Implementation of the counting sort algorithm.
- `103-merge_sort.c`: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
- `104-heap_sort.c`: Implementation of the heap sort algorithm.
- `105-radix_sort.c`: Implementation of the radix sort algorithm.
- `106-bitonic_sort.c`: Implementation of the bitonic sort algorithm.
- `107-quick_sort_hoare.c`: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm using the Hoare partition scheme.

Each directory contains source code files (`.c`), header files (`.h`), and `README.md` files specific to the tasks within that directory.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/efa07/sorting_algorithms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sorting_algorithms
    ```

3. Compile the source code using `gcc`. For example, to compile `0-bubble_sort.c`:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
    ```

## Usage

To run the compiled programs, use:
```
./bubble_sort
```

Each project directory may contain specific instructions and usage examples in their respective README.md files. Refer to those for more detailed information.
